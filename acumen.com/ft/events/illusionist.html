  What you  see is not always what it really is. It takes a magician to break the code of  an illusion. Are you the magician we are looking for? If yes, then prove it to  the world at The Illusionist event at Acumet IT 2011.<br />
  <strong>Description:</strong><br />
  This event  requires a team of 2 to participate. There are 3 levels. In the first level the  team that clears the cutoff making use of the clues can advance to the next  level. In the second and third levels the questions will get tougher but the  teams can take the help of the lifelines to reach THE ILLUSIONIST and claim  their reward. <br />
  <strong>Co- ordinators</strong>           :  P. Neelima.<br />
  <strong>Organizers</strong>                : Shashank, Nishanth, Preeti, Srikanth.</p>
