    <strong>RULES:</strong><br />
    1. The number of players in the  game should be 4.<br />
    2.&nbsp;When the game starts, the  4 players are the center of each of the sides of the grid and each player is  given 3 fences.<br />
    3. The player who hits the buzzer  first will be given a chance to answer the question, which has to be done  within the specified time of&nbsp;30 seconds.<br />
    4.&nbsp;If the player answers  correctly within the time he/she gets the opportunity to&nbsp;choose to move  forward or to put up one of his fences. When he/she has run out of fences, the  player must move forward.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt;Players  moves:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The player can move forward&nbsp;one square at a time,  horizontally or vertically, forwards or backwards.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;-&gt;Positioning of the fences<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The fences can be placed anywhere. The fences can be used to facilitate the  player’s progress or to impede that of the opponent; however, an access to the  goal line must always be left open.&nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;If the player  fails to answer correctly within the time&nbsp;his/her away would be blocked as  per the wish of the host. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;6. Face to face:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; When two players  face each other on neighboring squares which are not separated by a fence, the  player whose turn it is can jump &nbsp;the opponent(and place himself behind  him), thus advancing an extra square ). If there is a fence behind the said  player, the player can move to the left or the right of the other player.<br />
