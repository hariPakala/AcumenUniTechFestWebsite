  <p><strong>Clue  Quest:</strong><br />
    Team up  and start your adventurous journey, to unravel the most exciting treasure ever.  But it’s not easy- 4 levels of challenges and immense sweat and blood will lead  you to the ultimate prize. All the best!!!<br />
  <strong>     Description:</strong><br />
    This event consists of four different levels,  where difficulty increases with          each  level. Each team consists of three members. Initially each team is given seven  computers. Each computer has an application which has seven technical  questions. Solving each question correctly leads to a character. They should  arrange these jumbled characters into a technical term which serves as a  password to the next level (in next computer where this password matches).  Whichever team does this task (all the four levels) first will be the winner.<br />
