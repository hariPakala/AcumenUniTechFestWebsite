    <strong>Round  1:</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>This       competition will be on paper.</li>
    <li>A       set of programs will be given in two sections.</li>
    <li><strong><u>Section 1</u></strong><strong>:</strong> A       set of <strong>5</strong> difficult-to-understand short programs will be given (in C,C++ or Java).       The output of each program has to be predicted and written.</li>
    <li><strong><u>Section 2</u></strong><strong>:</strong> Another set of <strong>5</strong> difficult-to-understand short programs are given (in C, C++ or Java). The       output of each program has to be predicted. This predicted output will be       a sentence in jumbled form. The correct sentence has to be formed and       written.</li>
    <li>The       teams who have scored more than the cut-off will be qualified for the next       round.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Round  2:</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>This       competition will be on computer systems.</li>
    <li>A       set of <strong>5</strong> very difficult       problems will be given.</li>
    <li>Each       problem explains a scenario and describes a problem statement based on the       scenario.</li>
    <li>A       program has to be written to solve the problem stated.</li>
    <li>The       program must satisfy the input and output formats specified in the       problem.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It should be written in C, C++ or  Java and must not include any methods, etc. except stdin and stdout (standard  input-output methods).</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>The       program should be compiled, executed and saved on the computer system       itself.</li>
    <li>Teams       will be ranked according to the number of problems solved accurately.       Partially solutions to the problems will also be considered accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If there is any tie, the team  with greater code efficiency and earlier submission time will be given higher  priority.<br />
